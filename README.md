# Affinity: an visualisation tool for Enhanced Equivalence Projective Simulation

The original README can be found here: [EEPS](https://github.com/Asieh-A-Mofrad/Enhanced-Equivalence-Projective-Simulation)

## Motivation

This project was created as part of a summer project on the foundation year of the Interactive Artificial Intelligence Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Bristol

## Installation

The current build of Affinity

ADD INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SETUP CONDA ENVIRONMENT

Once all prerequisite packages have been installed, Affinity can be launched by running the `main.py` script

## Interface Design

Affinity's interface consists of four parts:

1. Parameter Toolbox
2. Visualisation Display
3. Control Panel
4. Relation Editor

### Parameter Toolbox

The Parameter toolbox allows modification of agent and environment parameters, as well as loading prior setups from previous experiments. Affinity has 

### Network Visualisation

The network tab on the main display contains visualisations of the agents clip space as a graph network 

### Heatmap Visualisation

### Realtional Density Theory Visualisations

### Stimuli Editor

### Experiment Designer

### Changes to EEPS

To achieve the aims of this project, several changes were made to the original EEPS code. These are outlined below

#### Visualisation Support

#### Network Enhancement During Training
