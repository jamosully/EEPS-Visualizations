# Affinity: an visualisation tool for Enhanced Equivalence Projective Simulation

The original README can be found here: [EEPS](https://github.com/Asieh-A-Mofrad/Enhanced-Equivalence-Projective-Simulation)

## Motivation and Project Objectives

This project was created as part of a summer project on the foundation year of the Interactive Artificial Intelligence Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Bristol

With this in mind, the key objectives of this prototype are:

1. To create a tool for visualising the the behavior of agent behavior during the training and testing stages of EEPS, both as a means of exploring simulations of RDT in EEPS and visualising projective simulation.
2. Provide a platform for the realtime manipulation of 

The objectives previously achieved in this project are:

1. Gain a deeper understanding of projective simulation and EEPS
2. Explore the simulation of RDT

## Installation

The current build of Affinity

ADD INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SETUP CONDA ENVIRONMENT

Once all prerequisite packages have been installed, Affinity can be launched by running the `main.py` script

## Structure of Affinity

## Interface Design

Affinity's interface consists of four parts:

1. Parameter Toolbox
2. Visualisation Display
3. Control Panel
4. Relation Editor

### Parameter Toolbox

![parameter_toolbox](Images/parameter_toolbox.png)

The Parameter toolbox allows modification of agent and environment parameters, as well as loading prior setups from previous experiments. Affinity has 

### Network Visualisation

![network_visualisation](Images/network_visualization.png)

The network tab on the main display contains visualisations of the agents clip space as a graph network 

### Heatmap Visualisation

### Realtional Density Theory Visualisations

### Stimuli Editor

### Experiment Designer

### Changes to EEPS

To achieve the aims of this project, several changes were made to the original EEPS code. These are outlined below

#### Visualisation Support

#### Network Enhancement During Training

## Future Work

- [ ] Drag and drop tabs
- [ ] Modifying connections via the heatmap visualisation
- [ ] An interface for creating new experiments
- [ ] A system for integrating other EEPS/EPS/PS variants within the visualisation framework of Affinity
- [ ] Various keyboard shortcuts
