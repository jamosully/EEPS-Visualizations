# Affinity: an visualisation tool for Enhanced Equivalence Projective Simulation

The original README can be found here: [EEPS](https://github.com/Asieh-A-Mofrad/Enhanced-Equivalence-Projective-Simulation)

## Motivation

This project was created as part of a summer project on the foundation year of the Interactive Artificial Intelligence Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Bristol

## Installation
